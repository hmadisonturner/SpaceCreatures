# SpaceCreatures

**Space Creatures** is a brand new retro arcade shooter in the tradition of your favorite vintage jams. Each of its bits (the ones ands zeros that make up the internet) is handcrafted by the skilled pixel technicians of a shadowy guild thought to inhabit disused barns and tobacco shacks throughout the galaxy, where they practice arcane religious rites (if religion you can call their diabolic creed) and menace the upright classes with a peculiar brand of leaderless aloofness.
